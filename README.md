## Description

### ðŸ’¼ About this project

About a year ago, I asked my [design team](https://app.manypixels.co/onboard?referral=cjxam0civ6d1z07704c0glafm) *(affiliate link)* to create [a mockup of a portfolio site that looks like a code editor](https://www.figma.com/file/GqXYhDV2zVOPyfx5gRmOOh/P21563---HW-Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1&t=Kep3FCw2dpJ7BLso-1). This mockup was for my partner, who had recently graduated Thinkful Software Engineering Immersion. He never built the website, so I took the mockup for myself and started to build it out from scratch to practice React. I changed it a bit to more closely resemble my own VSCode editor, including small easter eggs and links to extensions that I use on a daily basis.

### ðŸ§  What I learned

- Taking a [Figma Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/GqXYhDV2zVOPyfx5gRmOOh/P21563---HW-Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1&t=Kep3FCw2dpJ7BLso-1) and building it from scratch
- Using Github's API to import my repositories, using a special character to only showcase certain projects I designate
